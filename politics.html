                <p class="fw-blod">Politically as well as culturally and economically, the Kingdom of Morocco is an
                    important link
                    between North and South – the country is a central partner of the European Union and Germany in
                    northern Africa. Germany and Morocco have maintained diplomatic relations since 1956.

                    In the course of the last decade, Morocco has launched comprehensive reforms. The country plays a
                    key role in preserving stability and promoting sustainable development in the region, proven not
                    least by its diplomatic engagement in the Libyan peace process. With its newly appointed Personal
                    Envoy of the UN Secretary-General Staffan de Mistura, the United Nations is endeavouring to find a
                    solution to the Western Sahara issue.

                    <p><br> The German Government’s stance has remained unaltered for
                        decades. Germany is supporting the Personal Envoy in his efforts to find a just, lasting
                        political
                        solution acceptable to all based on UN Security Council Resolution 2602 (2021). In 2007, Morocco
                        made an important contribution to such a solution by presenting an autonomy plan.

                        Germany and Morocco enjoy significant economic and trade relations. In 2019, Germany ranked
                        seventh
                        among Morocco’s trading partners, with imports from Morocco amounting to 1.4 billion euro, and
                        exports to Morocco totalling 2.2 billion euro. There are nearly 300 companies with German equity
                        participation operating in Morocco, mainly concentrated in Casablanca and Tangier. Morocco is a
                        popular tourist destination. In 2019, approximately six percent of foreign tourists were from
                        Germany.

                        Germany is helping Morocco in its modernisation efforts and is one of the country's largest
                        bilateral donors, pledging funds to the tune of almost 1.2 billion euro in total in 2020.
                        German-Moroccan development cooperation focuses on sustainable economic development and jobs,
                        renewable energy and water management. Morocco is one of the countries in the G20 Compact with
                        Africa initiative aiming to improve conditions for private investment. To this end, the two
                        countries launched a German-Moroccan reform partnership in late November 2019. In 2020, Germany
                        supported Morocco with a comprehensive emergency assistance programme to mitigate the COVID-19
                        crisis.</p>

                    prerogatives in parliament</h1>
                <p class="fw-blod">The Popular Movement party in the House of Representatives has drawn up a proposal
                    for a law to the Justice and Legislation Committee, aimed at strengthening the constitutional rights
                    of the parliamentary opposition.
        
                    The draft bill proposal will detail and embolden the exercise of the parliamentarian opposition’s
                    constitutional rights in both Houses of Parliament, and fill what the movement calls “a legislative
                    void,” which limits the opposition’s exercise of their rights, listed in the constitution.
        
                    According to the parliamentary team, this law will enable the opposition to carry out the tasks
                    entrusted to it in the “utmost proper and complete manner.”

                        <summary>read all article</summary>
                        <p>The authors of the proposal consider that despite the fact that the Constitution guarantees the
                            rights of the parliamentary opposition and its protection, the two bylaws regulating the houses fail
                            to “comprehend the depth of the constitutional reform.”
        
                            The draft proposal targets the lack of mechanisms that guarantee the protection of the legislative
                            rights of the opposition, saying the laws in place “do not keep pace with the spirit of the 2011
                            constitution.”
        
                            The pending legislative proposal seeks to grant opposition groups a number of powers and
                            prerogatives, including the right to refer international treaties and agreements to the
                            Constitutional Court to ensure alignment with constitutional norms.</p>

                    Part of the program saw the presence of Sultan bin Ahmad Al Jaber, UAE Minister of Industry and Advanced

                    particular interest in renewable energy, advanced technology, agriculture, and other sectors.

                    the interests of the two peoples.”
                    Emirati official said in front of the high-ranking delegations, the minister said:
        
                    UAE occupies first place among the Arab countries in terms of the highest volume of foreign investment
                    in Morocco, which amounted to more than 20 billion dollars in 2020.
        
        
                    The official toured Morocco’s Dubai Expo pavilion set up to attract investments and highlight the
                    country’s cultural valuables. He praised to reporters the modern and traditional elements in the
                    pavilion, that’s been seen by over 25 million visitors over the last six months.
        
                    A group of Emirati officials is expected to attend Morocco’s national day celebrations Sunday, including
                    Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum, President of the Dubai Civil Aviation Authority, Chairman of the Expo
                    2020 Dubai Higher Committee, Sultan bin Ahmed Al Jaber, UAE’s Minister of Industry and Advanced
                    Technology, and Reem Al Hashemi, UAE Minister of State for International Cooperation.</p>
