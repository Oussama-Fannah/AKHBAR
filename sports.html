                <h1 class="fw-blod mx-sm-6 mx-lg-0">Six Moroccan tennis players suspended for corruption</h1>
                <p class="fw-blod">The International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA) announced the provisional suspension of six top Moroccan tennis players this December 14.

                    The cases were adjudicated by an independent anti-corruption hearing officer, Charles Hollander, who found the players guilty of various match-fixing offenses back in July of this year, in addition to charges of receiving money for fixing and failing to report corrupt approaches.
                    
                    The ITIA investigation found that the players’ offenses were linked and therefore were subject to a joint hearing.

                    <p> <br>Six months later, the ITIA issued the final sanctions against the Moroccan players. Amine Ahouda is banned for 11 years and fined $5,000, Anas Chakrouni, banned for 10 years and fined $5,000, Ayoub Chakrouni is banned for life and fined $10,000.

                        Mohamed Zakaria Khalil is banned for 9 years, fined $5,000, while Soufiane El Mesbahi is suspended for 9 years and fined $5,000, and Yassir Kilani, banned for 9 years, is fined $5,000.
                        
                        The sanctions mean that the players are prohibited from playing in or attending any tennis event authorized or sanctioned by any international tennis governing body or national association for the length of their bans.
                        
                        The players’ suspensions begin from the date of their provisional suspension – 13 July 2021 and they have 20 business days from the date of receipt of the decision to lodge an appeal with the Court of Arbitration for Sport. </p>
