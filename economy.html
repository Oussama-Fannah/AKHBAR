                open borders"</h1>
            <p class="fw-blod">Following the country’s extension of the health emergency, which includes a ban on travel
                until January 31, tourism professionals in the Draa-Tafilalet region have launched a campaign on social
                media with the hashtag “Support tourism, open borders.”

                Professionals carrying a poster titled “Support tourism, open borders” posted videos and photos on
                Facebook to express their desire to resume their activities, and save the sector after suffering great
                losses through the COVID-19 pandemic and the closing of borders.

                PUBLICITÉ

                Tourism professionals hope the government will provide support for the sector, since national tourism
                has been hit the hardest since the pandemic began, and the forecast for its recovery is far off,
                especially after the surge of the new variant.

                <p> <br> The shutdown also coincided with the new year’s holiday, pushing tourism professionals to warn about another loss in the sector.

                    Previously, the number of tourists coming to the kingdom during 2020 in Morocco was less than 3 million (2.8 million), a decrease of 78.5% compared to 2019, with this sector contributing approximately 7% to Morocco’s GDP, and employing about half a million people.
                    
                    Morocco has extended the closure of its borders until January 31, 2022, to stem the spread of COVID-19 after the first cases of Omicron appeared in the country.
                    
                    To date, Morocco has reported 26 confirmed Omicron cases, in addition to 46 suspected cases.</p>
