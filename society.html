                <p class="fw-blod">Morocco recorded 1,960 new Covid-19 cases on Thursday, raising the total of cases
                    since the beginning of the outbreak to 961,058.

                    The kingdom has also reported 2 Covid related deaths in the past 24 hours.

                    As of Thursday, the ministry of health reported a total of 14,844 people who died from Covid-19.


                    Morocco continues to bid on its national vaccination campaign, in an effort to contain the spread of
                    the coronavirus.
                    According to the ministry’s latest tally, 24,552,646 people received their first Covid-19 vaccine
                    shot, while 22,924,662 were fully inoculated.

                    Morocco has also administered a total of 2,932,157 booster shots, as of Thursday.

                    vacations</h1>
                <p class="fw-blod">Government spokesperson Mustapha Baitas announced that school winter vacations will
                    not be
                    extended, despite rising COVID-19 infection rates.

                    Speaking at the weekly press briefing following the government’s weekly government council this
                    Thursday,
                    December 30, the official stated that “there is no extension of the school vacation,” which is due
                    to end
                    this Sunday, January 2.

                    On whether the Scientific Committee will present a recommendation to the government in order to
                    extend the
                    inter-school vacation, previous sources confirmed to Hespress AR that this is “currently excluded
                    and there
                    is no direction in this direction.”

                        Two members of the scientific committee had told Hespress AR that “this point is currently not
                        being
                        discussed, and no decision has been taken in order to extend the holiday.”

                        They stressed that “students cannot be held responsible for the negligence and laxity of
                        parents, youth and
                        the elderly in adhering to the necessary precautions and in completing the stages of the
                        vaccination
                        process.”

                        The members of the scientific committee added that “the students were vaccinated in a large
                        proportion, as
                        the number of vaccinated people reached about two million and six hundred thousand out of two
                        million and
                        eight hundred thousand, which means that they contributed to collective immunity, unlike
                        adults.”</p>

                    virtually
                    or in-person</h1>
                <p class="fw-blod">Morocco’s education system has yet to decide on whether exams will take place
                    in-person or
                    remotely, with the exam season fast approaching in mid-January.

                    Morocco’s Minister of Higher Education, Abdelatif Miraoui, has urged all education establishments to
                    conduct
                    exams remotely until further notice.

                    The official made the request to the heads of universities saying that “the country has not yet
                    overcome the
                    risk of a new COVID-19 wave.”

                    However, a Hespress source from within the scientific committee confirmed that it is likely exams
                    will be
                    held in-person, similar to what happened the year before when the emergence of the delta variant
                    coincided
                    with the students’ exams.

                        Associate Professor of English at the Higher School of Technology in Laayoune, Limame Barbouchi,
                        told
                        Hespress EN in a statement that “the recent tougher sanitary precautions announced by the
                        Moroccan
                        government following the rapid spread of Omicron worldwide have brought back the possibility of
                        running
                        virtual classes and exams at the universities to guarantee pedagogical continuity.”

                        “At the time being, as it is difficult to evaluate the pandemic situation in Morocco, most
                        universities have
                        modified their exam dates to have Fall semester exams on-campus before the Fall vacation,” he
                        added.

                        Barbouchi said that if there is an increase in positive cases, it is very likely that classes
                        will be
                        conducted online in the upcoming semesters to ensure the safety of faculty, staff, and students.

                        As for remote exams, the Associate Professor said “online exams are debatable as they don’t
                        guarantee the
                        credibility of students’ answers,” he noted, adding, “However, according to different academic
                        studies and
                        researches, including an international conference on Distance Education we held at Higher School
                        of
                        Technology in Laayoune last June, online exams can be possibly held making use of the recent
                        technological
                        developments to reduce the cheating online as possible as one can.”

                        In response to Hespress EN’s question about recent technological advancements, the Associate
                        Professor gave
                        recommendations, such as: “the use of HD webcams to be imposed on students, new applications to
                        help
                        teachers create questions randomly, as well as new technology to allow students to control their
                        access to
                        other websites when taking online exams, such as Moodle,” he continued.

                        Currently, Moroccan universities haven’t decided on the format of exams but have begun
                        instituting stricter
                        measures to curtail the spread of the Omicron variant, including the control of students’
                        identities and
                        vaccination passes. </p>
